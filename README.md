Design Considerations
---------------------

Use JNI types in C-interface?
    Yes, because BEAM API is Java and as such it is much less verbous and more concise to reuse JNI types, and is aloso less work
    No, because the C-API shall be independent of its implementation or origin

Duplicate Java API (or parts) 1:1?  (e.g. any method in Java gets its C counterpart)
    Yes, because the Java API docs can be reused for C API.
    No, because a more concise C-API can be generated. And no, because changes in the Java API need to be reflected in the C API
     which will introduce a lot of work.

Shall C API functions return string buffers that users have to release later?
    Yes, otherwise the signature of Java counterparts is will be different, because by-reference arguments passing is required then.
         E.g. instead of
              char* name = get_name(obj);
              ...
              free(name);
         we have
              char name[81];
              get_name(obj, name, 80);
    No, because it is obvious that strings need to be freed on the users side.

Shall the API allow for modification of single structures elements that are passed as arguments by-reference.?
